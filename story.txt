Main Character: Suszane the old chicken. Setting: The farm and forest.
This is the story of a chicken named Suszane. Suszane was a large old hen who spent her whole life inside of a chicken coop. One day, regretful of never seeing anything more than the chicken coop, she left the safety of the her home to go on a great adventure.
She decided her first stop was going to be the farmer's house. AS she got close, a big dog jumped out and chased her. She ran away as quick as she could and hid in some bushes. The farmer's house was too dangerous to visit, she thought.

After the farmer's house didn't work out, Suzane decided to try and explore the forest.
Upon entering the forest, she was able to see the massive redwood trees towering
over her. She had never seen anything so tall in her life and felt intimidated.
As she went further into the forest, she started to feel like she was being watch.
Then, out of the corner of her eye, she saw two eyes hiding in a bush looking at
her. It was a wolf!

The wolf was the size of a jelly bean. The wolf was also yellow,
which is kinda weird. Suzane ate the wolf because he looked tasty. 
Suzane was so horrified by what she had done after sobering up that she
traveled to the nearest farmer's market in the nearby town and buying
lettuce to feed the wolf. She would eat the lettuce and the wolf would eat
the lettuce inside her stomache.
